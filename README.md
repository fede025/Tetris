Overview
Welcome to the Tetris project, a modern take on the classic Tetris game. This project is a fully functional Tetris game that includes features such as a game loop that updates the game state, a player piece that can be moved and rotated, collision detection, and score updating. The game is built with a focus on clean, efficient code and a user-friendly interface. The game board is dynamically created and rendered on a canvas element, and the game state is constantly updated and displayed to the player.

git clone https://github.com/fede025/Tetris.js.git   

Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):
cd yourrepository
npm Tetris
This will install all development dependencies, as specified in the package.json file.

Run the Project
You can now run the project using the following command:
npm run dev
This will start the development server.
